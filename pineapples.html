        <h2><i>Why does it feel like your mouth is burning when you eat pineapple?</i></h2>
        <p>The reason it feels like that is because the chemical bromelian dissolces the protective mocous that is covering your tongue and the roof of your mouth all the time, and the acidity of the pineapples is what irritates your mouth.</p>
